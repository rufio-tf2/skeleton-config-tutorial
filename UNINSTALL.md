## Restore your backup

If you want to remove my config and restore your backup, follow these steps.

1.  Close TF2
1.  Delete the `rufio-config` folder inside of your `custom` folder.
1.  Move a copy of your `config_backup.cfg` file into your `cfg` folder
1.  Restart TF2 and go into a custom server.
1.  Open the console and type `exec config_backup` and press Enter.

Test out your keys and settings to ensure they're all working as expected. There's a good chance that one of the keys that my config changed won't have reverted correctly.
